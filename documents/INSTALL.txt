>> AROUNDMe Personal identity installation guide
   This guide is intended for anyone wishing to install AROUNDMe Personal
   identity. An understanding of domain name setup, FTP, changing
   directory privileges and web servers is required. Please read the
   terms of the license prior to installation.


>> Overview
   You will use a domain or subdomain such as example.org or
   tom.example.org for your installation. This guide covers a four step
   installation; uploading AROUNDMe Personal identity, setting up your
   domain or subdomain, running the installer and finally accessing your
   installation and testing the installation.


>> Pre installation checks
   AROUNDMe Personal identity requires a web server running either Apache
   1.3/2.x or IIS5/IIS6 with PHP5.x installed including Curl, BCMath and
   GD library.

   The installer does it's best to check for these things and inform you,
   so if in doubt the best strategy is to continue.


>> Extracting and uploading
   Download the latest release of AROUNDMe Personal identity and unzip/untar
   it onto your local computer. FTP upload ALL the files up a directory on
   your webserver. Write down the path to the index.php file which will be
   something like:

       /public_html/aroundme_pi_2008_01_16/aroundme_pi/

   The above path will be used for all following examples.


>> Setting up your domain / subdomain
   The URL you choose for your installation becomes your OpenID identity. 
   This can be in one of three possible formats:


       domain:http://domain.org
       subdomain:http://identity.domain.org
       directory:http://domain.org/identity

   Each Internet service provider has a different way to set up this. Look
   through your control panel and if in doubt contact your Internet service
   provider support team and ask them "How do I point .http://domain.org
   to /public_html/aroundme_pi_2008_01_16/aroundme_pi/ "?

   If you are installing onto your local computer for testing or onto a
   dedicated server then see SUBDOMAINS.TXT for Vhost and .htaccess
   information.


>> Installing AROUNDMe Personal identity
   Open your browser and type in your OpenID. You will be presented with an
   installation screen. Follow the instructions on screen. Once complete
   AROUNDMe Personal identity will be installed.


>> Testing your installation
   After installation follow the link to your OpenID or type the URL
   directly into a browser. You are automatically logged in. Press the
   'disconnect' at the top of the page to log out. You will see a 'connect'

   'go'. You will now be logged in to your installation of AROUNDMe
   Personal identity. Press disconnect to log out.

   Enter either http://tom.calthrop.info or http://sebastian.oblom.se into

   the web page and press 'GO'.
