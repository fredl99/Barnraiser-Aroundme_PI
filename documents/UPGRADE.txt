>> Upgrading AROUNDMe Personal identity
   
   1. Backup [never skip this]
   2. Upload the new installation into a new directory and copy the following
      files / directories from your old release to your new one:

          aroundme_pi/.htaccess (in aroundme_pi directory if applicable)
          aroundme_pi/core/config/aroundme_core.config.php
          assets/
          data1234/ (the direcoty name is always "data" followed by some
                    random numbers)

   3. Edit your aroundme_core.config.php file and add todays date in the
      installation date:

          $core_config['release']['install_date'] = "01-16-2008";

      and save it.

   4. Change the installer so that nobody can use it. Most ISP's give you a
      file manager from which you can select the installation/installer.php
      file and remove all permissions. Alternatively you can do it from the
      command line:

          chmod 0000 installation/installer.php

   5. Re-point your OpenID url from your old directory to your new
      directory. You are done!
