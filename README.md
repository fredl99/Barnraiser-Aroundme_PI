# Barnraiser-AroundMe_PI

## About

This project was published on http://barnraiser.org/ a while ago. Although it has very promising features it was frozen and finally dropped for reasons that are explained [here](http://barnraiser.org/signing_off). According to this the main reason was the rise of similar products by companies with sufficient economic power to attract more users than a small enthusiastic bunch of coders.

Today we know where that evolution led us and there's a tendency to move away from data-miners back to software under personal control. Funny enough this was exactly the intention of all projects at http://barnraiser.org/. We could say they were just a bit too far ahead of their time.

Fortunately the latest versions of the projects are still available on their website. In order to preserve the code and hopefully help to adjust it to modern requirements I took the freedom to import them here. 

This is the latest version aroundme_pi_20080116.tar.gz found at http://barnraiser.org/aroundme. This, as well as the identity server AroundMe_I and the collaboration server AroundMe_C can be found at http://download.savannah.gnu.org/releases/aroundme/. I have also set up git-repositories of the latter two here at Github.

I'm not an experienced programmer, so there's not so much activity to be expected from my side. Much more this repository should be considerd as a base-camp for real coders who are able and willing to spend some time on these projects. I don't mind if they fork and develop on their own or ask for write-access to this repo. Although in the first case I would appreciate pull requests in order to keep the things together.

The following is the original description from its homepage http://barnraiser.org/aroundme
